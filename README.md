# Hi there 👋

My name is Kev, I'm the DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response) lead for Bank of America across Europe. Aside from Information Security, I also enjoy web design so this GitHub account lists the **personal** projects that I'm involved in.

## My projects

I really enjoy web design and learning new stuff, but I'm not a professional web developer (far from it, actually). Here's some of my personal projects for you to peruse.

### Simple.css

[Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) is a classless CSS framework that is designed to create good looking websites from plain old HTML. You can see a full demo of what Simple.css can accomplish on a site [here](https://simplecss.org/demo).

I've also written a **very** verbose guide on how to setup a Jekyll site using Simple.css. You can find that post [right here](https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/).

### Quirky WordPress

[Quirky](https://github.com/kevquirk/quirky-wordpress) is a no-frills WordPress theme that has a brutalist design to it, with a bit of whimsy. It's the theme that I'm currently using on [my personal website](https://kevq.uk).

It's also one of the very few WordPress sites that qualifies for the The 512KB Club. Speaking of which...

### The 512KB Club

[The 512KB Club](https://512kb.club) is a collection of performance-focused web pages from across the Internet. The one and only rule for a web page to qualify as a member is...

Your total **UNCOMPRESSED** web resources must not exceed 512KB.

The internet has become a bloated mess. Massive JavaScript libraries, countless client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the course these days.

When online newspapers like The Guardian are over 4MB in size, you know there's a problem. Why does an online newspaper need to be over 4MB in size? It's crazy.

But we can make a difference - all it takes is some optimisation. Do you really need that extra piece of JavaScript? Does your WordPress site need a theme that adds lots of functionality you're never going to use? Are those huge custom fonts really needed? Are your images optimised for the web?
