## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kev, I'm the DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response) lead for Bank of America across Europe. Aside from Information Security, I also enjoy web design so this GitHub account lists the **personal** projects that I'm involved in.

## Simple.css

[Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) is a classless CSS frame work that is design to create good looking websites from plain old HTML. You can see a full demo of what Simple.css can accomplish on a site [here](https://simplecss.org/demo).

I've also written a **very** verbose guide on how to setup a Jekyll site using Simple.css. You can find that post [right here](https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/).

## Nineteen Quirky

[Nineteen Quirky](https://github.com/kevquirk/nineteen-quirky) is a no-frills WordPress theme that harps back to the good old Geocities days of the 90s. Except it has a modern twist. I used to use this theme on my [personal site](https://kevq.uk) before deciding to migrate from WordPress to Jekyll.
